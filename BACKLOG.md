# Backlog and open questions

No open questions are currently blocking PR5. The owner authorized the sustainable choice: PR5 commits a sanitized, transient `EventLine` to an `ingest_events` staging store linked to `ingest_batches`, then deletes the buffer only after that transaction commits. PR6/PR7 consume and remove staged events during classification and aggregation; the store has no IP or raw User-Agent fields and is not an export surface.

The owner chose a UTC-midnight rotation boundary for PR4. A missed rotation writes and retains an `alarm` state for `analytics:maintenance` in `system_heartbeats`, which is the durable operator-facing operational state for the future authenticated health endpoint.

Until PR4 introduces the salts table and rotation, the PR2 site map omits the `salt` key by owner decision; section 7.3 records the sequencing rule.
