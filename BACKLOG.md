# Backlog and open questions

No open questions are currently blocking PR4. The owner chose a UTC-midnight rotation boundary. A missed rotation writes and retains an `alarm` state for `analytics:maintenance` in `system_heartbeats`, which is the durable operator-facing operational state for the future authenticated health endpoint.

Until PR4 introduces the salts table and rotation, the PR2 site map omits the `salt` key by owner decision; section 7.3 records the sequencing rule.
